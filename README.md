# Portfolio FIP

I'm Emmanuel Kabongo! Welcome to my portfolio website, I try to keep it updated as much as possible so you can keep up with my progress, and even reach out to me so we can get some work done! Feel free to have a look around.
I've made a lot of changes to the website throughout the year, the first thing you might notice is the cleaner animations thanks to the help of greensock, and I was also able to implement a theme change.
Now that the dark theme is here, more being stuck with the light theme, although it is an option if that's your preference.
Unecessary images like pngs of certain brand icons have been removed, and now I source a script from fontawesome in order to access any icons, such as Github, LinkedIn or even YouTube which saved me quite some
space and makes working on the website a lot easier. My most notable addition however is the case study page. Although there is a whole section dedicated to the tools I use at the bottom of the home page, 
I thought it would be more informative to showcase how exactly I put those tools to use on some of my projects!
